## Abstract 

The market capitalization of stablecoins has surged from US$5 billion in 2019 to over US$180 billion in 2022. These blockchain-based assets emulate traditional currencies with unique stabilizing mechanisms. This study examines the efficacy of stablecoin mechanisms through covered interest parity (CIP), which suggests that interest rate differentials between currencies should align with forward and spot exchange rate differentials.

Analyzing Tether (USDT), USD Coin (USDC), and Binance USD (BUSD), the study finds persistent CIP deviations in decentralized finance (DeFi) environments, compared to traditional lending protocols like AAVE and Venus. For instance, USDT exhibited an average deviation of 0.068% with Treasuries, and 0.073% with AAVE, highlighting the nascency of DeFi. Contrary to traditional finance, these deviations do not follow seasonal trends but are influenced by stability perceptions and redemption capabilities. Using a vector autoregressive model, events like the FTX collapse and USDC depeg caused surges in deviations, severely denting investor confidence.

The study also explores how blockchain transaction costs impact CIP deviations, interpreting higher costs as frictions that hinder arbitrage. The launch of USDC-USDT perpetual futures on Binance improved liquidity and narrowed deviations. CIP deviations indicate liquidity and market sentiment issues for stablecoin issuers, and understanding these deviations is crucial for DeFi participants in asset pricing and risk management.
